# Portal-Form-Analysis
This is a project where I used a python script to extract data from a PDF document and write it's contents into Excel.

IMPORTANT:
This project can only be executed on the work laptop I once owned because of the file paths in the code as well as the PDFs and Excel documents that are involved with the script. However, I no longer own the laptop because my internship ended and the PDFs and the Excel documents are all confidential documents from Ontario Ministry of Transportation. This script does not contain any private information and so I was allowed to share it here. However, the script will not work without the conditions I previously mentioned. This script is meant for observational purposes only.
